# flocking_predators
Assignment: Using your dynamic flocking/predator system as the base, create a system that changes over time. 
It can tell a story or not, but it should have some tension and release, and development over time. 
Ryoichi Kurokawaâ€™s work could be a great example. 
Another would be the visuals for that cello performance that Robert Hodgin made. 
Give some consideration to what the sketch looks like too, not just the motion. 
Make deliberate choices for the visuals. This assignmnet is about composition. (Due Mon. Nov. 19)
